          <p>It would be a disgrace against gaming, and frankly, a travesty against humanity, to compile a list of prominent persons in video games without include Miyamoto. One may easily argue that he is mostly responsible for video games, at least in their current form. He is, after all, the creator of Mario, the most successful video game series in history.</p>

            Even if you don't realize it, John Carmack's contributions are felt every time you turn on a modern console. He is significantly responsible for the transition of video games into the realm of 3D. He is regarded as one of the most technically accomplished video game creators in history. He demonstrated to the world that video games could be more than just side scrolling platformers using the technologies he designed at id Software.

        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p> His main series, Metal Gear, pioneered the use of cut scenes in video games on a scale never seen before. He had no qualms about spending a significant portion of his game not actually playing the game.Not the game play, but the over-the-top tale delivered through spectacular cut sequences is one of the main reasons for this. Kojima concluded that the story he wanted to portray in the Metal Gear games couldn't be told solely through gameplay. To develop the game he intended to make, he recognized he needed to take cut sequences and push them to their limits, which he accomplished.</p>

          <p>Will Wright is one of the few video game creators who has made gaming accessible to the general public. The Sims is one of the most popular video game franchises of all time, and the game's target market isn't the same individuals that rush out to buy Call of Duty on launch day. Long before Nintendo's Wii, Wright figured out how to get into the wallets of casual gamers.Will Wright had a different perspective on video games than the majority of people in the late 1980s. Will Wright was more concerned with simply playing than with winning and losing, dying and living. As the original Sim City demonstrates, he considered games to be toys. Will Wright discovered that instead than striving to "beat the game," some individuals just wanted to have fun.</p>
